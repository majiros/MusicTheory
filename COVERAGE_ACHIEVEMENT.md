## 🔬 Phase 17-18 Details

### Phase 17: Final85PercentTests (ac3ec94)
- **Result:** 84.7% maintained (no line increase)
- **Tests Added:** 8 tests (908 total)
- **Purpose:** API validation and robustness testing
- **Key Learnings:**
  - Validated correct API usage (TimeSignature.Numerator/Denominator)
  - Removed tests for non-existent APIs (KeySignatureInference, RationalFactor comparison)
  - Added comprehensive validation tests for core classes

**Test Coverage:**
- Chord basic functionality
- VoiceRanges validation
- BaseNoteValueExtensions edge cases
- Duration operations (2 tests)
- RationalFactor arithmetic
- TimeSignature validation (2 tests)

### Phase 18: EdgeCaseTests (66e9a2c) ✅ **FINAL ACHIEVEMENT**
- **Result:** **84.8%** (+0.1%, +1 line, +1 branch, +1 method)
- **Tests Added:** 7 tests (915 total)
- **Purpose:** Exception path testing for validation branches
- **Achievement:** Successfully increased coverage to 84.8%

**Test Coverage:**
1. `TimeSignature_Constructor_ThrowsOnInvalidNumerator`: Tests numerator <= 0 validation (0, -1)
2. `TimeSignature_Constructor_ThrowsOnInvalidDenominator`: Tests denominator validation (0, -1, non-power-of-two: 3, 5, 6)
3. `BarBeatTick_Constructor_ThrowsOnNegativeValues`: Tests negative validation (bar/beat/tickWithinBeat < 0)
4. `RationalFactor_Addition_ProducesReducedFraction`: Tests 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2 with reduction
5. `Duration_ToString_ReturnsTicksRepresentation`: Tests ToString includes Ticks value
6. `Duration_GetHashCode_ConsistentForSameValue`: Tests GetHashCode consistency
7. `Duration_Equals_WorksWithObject`: Tests Equals(object) override

**Coverage Impact:**
- Line: 3,115 → 3,116 (+1)
- Branch: 2,512 → 2,513 (+1)
- Method: 533 → 534 (+1)

## ⚠️ Attempted Phase 19-20 (Not Committed)

### Phase 19: FinalPushTests (Not Committed)
- **Result:** 84.8% (no change)
- **Tests Created:** 15 tests (930 tests if kept)
- **Reason for Removal:** All tests hit already-covered paths
- **Focus:** RationalFactor operators, Duration edge cases, Tempo validation, BarBeatTick methods

### Phase 20: FinalGapTests (Not Committed)
- **Result:** 84.8% (no change)
- **Tests Created:** 8 tests (938 tests if kept)
- **Reason for Removal:** All tests hit already-covered paths
- **Focus:** DurationNotation error paths

**Key Insight:** Phase 19-20 revealed that 84.8% represents a natural plateau. The remaining 15.2% (555 lines) consists of complex branching logic and edge cases in large analyzer classes that require integration-level testing rather than unit-level testing.

## 📈 Coverage by Class (Top Gaps)

### Classes with Remaining Gaps
| Class | Coverage | Uncovered Lines | Complexity |
|-------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| HarmonyAnalyzer | 72.1% | 137 lines | Complex harmony analysis logic |
| ProgressionAnalyzer | 70.7% | 99 lines | Progression detection algorithms |
| ChordRomanizer | 82.5% | 66 lines | Romanization edge cases |
| RomanInputParser | 76.5% | 61 lines | Input parsing variations |
| KeyEstimator | 85.3% | 53 lines | Key estimation heuristics |

### Classes with High Coverage
| Class | Coverage | Status |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Duration | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| Tempo | 100% | ✅ Complete |
| CadenceAnalyzer | 94.7% | ⚡ Excellent |
| KeyEstimator | 85.3% | ⚡ Excellent |
| ChordAnalyzer | 84.0% | ⚡ Excellent |

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked
1. **Phased Approach:** Incremental testing in focused phases maintained stability
2. **Exception Path Testing:** Phase 18's validation testing successfully added coverage
3. **API Discovery:** grep_search and read_file helped identify correct APIs
4. **Build-Test Cycle:** Consistent rebuild + test ensured accurate measurements

### What Didn't Work
1. **Small Gap Strategy (Phase 19-20):** 89-97% classes have hard-to-reach remaining paths
2. **Operator Overload Tests:** RationalFactor operators already covered by existing tests
3. **Edge Case Duplication:** Many "edge cases" were already tested indirectly

### Plateau Analysis
**84.8% represents a natural coverage plateau** because:
- Remaining gaps are in complex analyzer classes (70-82% coverage)
- These classes have deep branching logic requiring integration tests
- Unit-level edge case testing doesn't reach these paths
- Further improvement requires comprehensive integration test scenarios

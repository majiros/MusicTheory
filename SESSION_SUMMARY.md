## 🎓 Key Insights from Phase 19-20

### What We Learned
1. **84.8% is a natural plateau** for unit-level testing
2. **Small gap strategy fails** after 85% coverage
3. **Integration tests required** for further improvement
4. **23 tests added 0% coverage** - clear signal to stop unit testing
5. **High-coverage classes** (95%+) don't benefit from edge case tests

### What We Documented
- Coverage improvement strategy rankings (effective → mixed → low)
- Plateau detection methodology (3+ attempts with 0% gain)
- Unit test ceiling vs. integration test effectiveness
- Practical guidelines for when to stop adding tests
- Realistic expectations (85% excellent, not 95%+)

### What We Recommend
**Option 1 (Recommended):** Accept 84.8% as excellent achievement
**Option 2 (Perfectionists):** Add 5-10 integration tests for +0.5-1.0%
**Option 3 (Balanced):** Maintain 84.8%, add critical path integration tests only

---

## 🔮 Future Work (Optional)

### Remaining Todo (1/5)
**2. Integration Test Foundation** (Not started)
- Design integration test strategy for 85%+ goal
- Create HarmonyAnalyzer/ProgressionAnalyzer scenario tests
- Target: C→Am→F→G typical progression patterns
- Estimated effort: 2-3 sessions
- Expected gain: +0.5-1.0% coverage

### Potential Enhancements
- Architecture diagrams (class relationships, data flow)
- API reference documentation (auto-generated from XML comments)
- Performance optimization guide
- Example projects (console app, web API)
- Video tutorials
